# Overview

This is the first repository of scriptures for the open source religion I that founded.

According to the Wikipedia a religion is:

> .. usually defined as a social-cultural system of designated behaviors and practices, morals, beliefs, worldviews, texts, sanctified places, prophecies, ethics, or organizations, that generally relates humanity to supernatural, transcendental, and spiritual elements;
> 

Regardless of the fact that todayâ€™s mainstream understanding; a religion:

- Is not necessarily include supernatural, transcendental and spiritual elements.
- Is not necessarily claim it is sent by God.
- Is not necessarily include Heaven and Hell.
- Is not necessarily be immutable.

Simply put, a religion is a set of beliefs, and this is what you are going to see while discovering this repository. I created this repository to reflect my own set of beliefs to share and improve with people's contributions.

## Why an Open Source Religion?

World is changing from how we live and work to how we communicate and trade today. It is not the same medium with times where current common religions have founded. It's long overdue that we discuss what and how we believe. I have few reasons to found a new religion, and make it open source:

1. Today, most widely practiced religions are built top-down. Yes, they are reflecting long standing cultures and practices within the culture they are borning in, yet not that each creed is result of a consensus of the society.
2. Second problem I see with today's religions is, they are considered as immutable by their followers. One can say that we can find lots of practices that have evolved and keep evolving. That's true. We can find many examples of practices where they have been changed a lot from what they were at the very early days of that religion. But, theoretically, they have tendency to resist changes. In addition, it is almost impossible for core principles to change (Like the existence of a God). This nature makes these religions always outdated.
