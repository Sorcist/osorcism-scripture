# Overview

This is the first repository of scriptures for the open source religion I that founded.

According to the Wikipedia a religion is:

> .. usually defined as a social-cultural system of designated behaviors and practices, morals, beliefs, worldviews, texts, sanctified places, prophecies, ethics, or organizations, that generally relates humanity to supernatural, transcendental, and spiritual elements;
> 

Regardless of the fact that todayâ€™s mainstream understanding; a religion:

- Is not necessarily include supernatural, transcendental and spiritual elements.
- Is not necessarily claim it is sent by God.
- Is not necessarily include Heaven and Hell.
- Is not necessarily be immutable.

Simply put, a religion is a set of beliefs, and this is what you are going to see while discovering this repository.
